          Eformative site created by Neko Carrera Designs, graphics by Hager

          <br />
          The site was created to start an alternative marketplace for electric
          transportation alternatives to create a greener environment for all of
          us to live in. It is our belief that we can make the world a better
          place and help stave off future destruction of the environment by
          joining together to save it.
